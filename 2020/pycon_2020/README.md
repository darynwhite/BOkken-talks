# Multiply your Testing Effectiveness with Parametrized Testing

*Was scheduled for 5:10 pm, Friday, April 17.*  
*Will hopefully be online soon-ish.*
  
**Summary:** Parametrization is one of the superpowers of pytest. 
It allows you to cover a huge number of test cases with a single test function. 
This speeds up test writing and makes test maintenance easier. 
This talk is a medium depth dive into pytest parametrization, with techniques you 
can use right away.

This talk will use of code examples, starting with a simple test then 
demonstrating 3 methods of parametrization, as well as test case identifiers 
and using generators.
